AI / ML: Local LLM integration (Ollama), deterministic regression, NLP
Software Design: Object-Oriented Programming, modular and scalable architectures
Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, basic database design

🔹 Notable Projects

NutriRank

- Developed an AI-powered nutrition assistant to help users make goal-driven food choices.
- Implemented local LLM-based intent recognition (Ollama) to understand food descriptions.
- Built deterministic logic for calorie analysis, food comparisons, and personalized recommendations.
- Modular architecture allows for future integration of machine learning models for nutrient prediction.

UCI Tuition & Financial Planning Simulator

- Developed an interactive web tool to calculate UCI tuition costs in real-time.
- Implemented dynamic updates to reflect tuition, fees, scholarships, and financial aid, allowing users to understand their net cost instantly.
- Designed a responsive interface with clear input handling and modular logic for cost calculations.
- Enabled future extension for additional financial scenarios or institutional policy updates.

Begin with Python

- Built a modular educational website for structured, self-paced Python learning.
- Implemented lessons, videos, and hands-on mini-projects entirely with HTML/CSS.
- Designed lesson flow and interactive exercises to help beginners learn Python concepts effectively.
- Iteratively refined content and site design to improve learner engagement and comprehension.

Unix Like Shell Implementation

- Developed a Unix-like command-line shell that interprets and executes user commands.
- Implemented core shell functionalities including command parsing, process creation, input/output redirection, and pipeline handling.
- Handled built-in commands, environment variables, and signal management to mimic standard Unix behavior.
- Designed a modular architecture to allow easy addition of new commands and features, supporting extensibility and maintainability.
